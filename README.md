# Learning for Everyone

**Where to start learning**

<div style="text-align: justify;">As any person begins to learn, there is a learning path which should be followed from the start. This ensures that he gets the relevent knowledge in an order which will maximize the chances of success. Many of the times, this learning path is not ensured by anyone. The learner later comes to know various things which he should have learned earlier. This document is just a small step in this idea. If even a single person gets benefit from it, the idea is a success.</div>
